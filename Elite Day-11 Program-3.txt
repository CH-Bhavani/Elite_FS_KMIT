There are B bags containing N gold boxes each. In each bag, gold boxes are 
arranged  in ascending order of their weights strictly, create a method in 
such a way that we need to return the least weight of gold box which is 
common least weight in all the given bags.

If we donâ€™t have any common least weighted gold box, among all the bags then return -1.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two integers B and N, number of bags and number of goldboxes in each Bag.
Next B lines: N space separated integers, weights of GoldBoxes.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the least weight of gold box, if found
Print -1, if not found.
